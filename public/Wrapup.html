    <h1>🧠 Wrap-Up Discussion</h1>

    <h2>1. What is an event in your own words?</h2>
    <p>
        I think of an event as a notification that the browser sends out to tell the code that something important just happened. It's basically a signal! It's not just things I do with the mouse, like clicking or hovering (which I did a lot in the tasks), but it also includes pressing a key on the keyboard, or even the whole webpage finishing loading. It's the moment when my code gets permission to run an action.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Why do websites need event listeners?</h2>
    <p>
        Websites need event listeners because they are the "hook" that connects the event (the signal) to the function (the action). If I have a great function that changes the background color, it's completely useless until I use an event listener, like <code>document.body.onclick = changeColor</code>, to make it run. The listener is what makes the page interactive, turning a static HTML page into a dynamic website that actually responds to me. Without them, buttons wouldn't button, and games wouldn't play!
    </p>

    <h2>3. How could you use events to make a quiz, a game, or a drawing app?</h2>
    <p>
        After finishing the coding bonus, I can see how events are the foundation for almost anything interactive. Here are some examples of how I'd use them:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Making a Quiz:</strong> I would use the <strong>onclick</strong> event listener on all the answer buttons. When a user clicks an option, the listener would run a function that checks if the answer matches the correct answer, gives instant feedback ("Correct!" or "Wrong!"), and updates the user's score.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Making a Simple Game:</strong> Just like I did in Task 5, I would use <strong>onkeypress</strong>. I would listen for specific keys like the arrow keys or 'S', 'R' to control a player on the screen. Pressing a key runs a function that changes the player's position, making the game playable.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Making a Drawing App:</strong> This would need two main events. I would use <strong>onmousedown</strong> to know when the user first pushes the mouse button down to start drawing, and then use <strong>onmousemove</strong> to draw a continuous line as long as the mouse is moving and the button is still pressed. When the user lifts the button, I would use <strong>onmouseup</strong> to stop drawing the line.
        </li>
    </ul>
